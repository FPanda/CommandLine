# CommandLine
1. Introduction  
  Most of us know the module named optParser in Python. It allows users to define the way to parse the command line input by themselves.  
  But it seems complex to do such a thing in C/C++ since no 3rd part or stl lib supported. CommandLine Parser is aimed  to solve this problem in C/C++.  
  Users just need to config the way to parse command line by xml flie and this allow them to focus on the feature they should develop.  
  This will reduce the time wasting in handle the command line arguments.
